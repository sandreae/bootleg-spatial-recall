### HOW TO

To make an impulse, go to the place you want to record and record a sound and its decay. Good sound sources include a balloon popping, and the coming together of two hands to make a clap. Other involuntary sound sources could also be used. There are loads of variables including weather, distance from mics, presence of other people that can affect your impulse and be a part of it.

If you don't have a recording device a phone is more than capable of capturing decent sound.

<br>

Trim the recording so it starts right at the beginning of the sound, and ends when the decay of the sound has finished. For a more in-depth how-to you can read <a href="/bsr-recording-guide.pdf">this</a> guide.

File formats: **wav** and **mp3** files are fully supported, **m4a** is partially supported as it has compatibility issues with some mobile device browsers, other formats may well work but you're safest with the ones mentioned. Please get in touch if you have any issues uploading or playing back your impulse.
