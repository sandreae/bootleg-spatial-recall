### HOW TO
<br>
To make an impulse, go to the place you want to record and record a sound and its decay. Good sound sources include a balloon popping, and the coming together of two hands to make a clap. Other involuntary sound sources could also be used. There are loads of variables including weather, distance from mics, presence of other people that can affect your impulse and be a part of it. 
<br>
If you don't have a recording device, a phone is more than capable.
<br>
<br>
Trim the recording so it starts right at the beginning of the sound, and ends when the decay of the sound has finished. For a more in-depth how-to you can read [this] guide.
<br>
<br>
We would recommend that you upload the impulse from a computer, rather than directly from a phone as there is still some teething behind the scenes.
<br>
<br>
Once youâ€™ve uploaded, it will appear among the list of impulses, and you can listen to your impulse convolved with the example audio on the home page.

<br>
If you've uploaded a file and feel very strongly that you would like it to be removed, please get in touch.
