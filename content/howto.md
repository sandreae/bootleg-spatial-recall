### HOW TO
<br>
You need something to make a sound with, and something to record the sound with. If you don’t have a recorder, a phone recording is more than capable. A sound like a balloon burst or a loud clap works well.
<br>
<br>
Once you’ve recorded the impulse, if possible, trim down the  audio clip so it starts right at the beginning of the sound, and ends when the decay of the sound has finished. You should be able to do this on your phone or on some audio software before uploading. For a more in-depth how-to you can read [this] guide.
<br>
<br>
We would recommend that you upload the impulse from a computer, rather than directly from a phone as there is still some teething behind the scenes.
<br>
<br>
Once you’ve submitted, it will appear among the list of impulses, and you can hear your impulse convolved with the example audio on the homepage of the site.

The site should be able to handle most audio file types but there may be some bugs we don't know about yet, so please get in contact if you have any problems.
