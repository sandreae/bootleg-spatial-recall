### HOW TO

<br>

You need something to make a sound with, and something to record the sound with. If you don’t have a recorder, a phone recording is more than capable. A sound like a balloon burst or a loud clap works well.

<br>

Once you’ve recorded the impulse, if possible, trim down the  audio clip so it starts right at the beginning of the sound, and ends when the decay of the sound has finished. You should be able to do this on your phone or on some audio software before uploading. For a more in-depth how-to you can read [this] guide.

<br>

Once you’ve submitted, it will appear among the list of impulses, and you can hear your impulse convolved with the example audio on the homepage of the site.

File formats: **wav** and **mp3** files are fully supported, **m4a** is partially supported as it has compatibility issues with some browsers, other formats may well work but you're safest with the ones mentioned. Please get in touch if you have any issues uploading or playing back your impulse.
