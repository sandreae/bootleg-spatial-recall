### About

<br>

**Bootleg Spatial Recall** is an archive of the echoes of spaces. 

<br>

It functions as a way of sharing and listening to common spaces which are accessible to all, spaces around us, shadowed spaces, edgelands, and bringing them into common domains. Places that contain our lives and make up our environment and experience of it. 

<br>

The site is a public sourced archive, and is a tool for listening to our environments and hearing it grow, adapt and in some cases disappears.

<br>

**Convolution** is a process used for digitally simulating the reverbaration of a physical space. 
Normally the domain of hi end sound design, a lot of maths and a lot of equipment. Bootleg Spatial Recall uses WebAudio to convolve the samples so anyone can make use of the effect quickly and easily. This is by no means trying to accurately capture the acoustics, but more of a bootlegged approach, recognising that each of us may hear different things in the space places, and that spaces and their reverberations change and respond to different things.
 
<br>

On the site you can listen to the impulses submitted, convolved with some example audio, and the isolated impulses. You can also submit your own impulse recordings by the 'upload' page, and there is some information there on how to do that. It's very easy! You can submit a recording of any space you like, but there is a gentle focus on public and common space that is shared.

<br>

The reverb impulses in the repository can also be downloaded to use however you like. A guide to how you could use them in your own projects can be read here<link>.

Bootleg Spatial Recall seems to have a couple of issues on safari, so we would recommend you use a different browser.

<br>

It has been created as part of a project by [Otto Willberg](http://www.ottowillberg.com/) which includes a record called Barbaric Mystical Bored, which can be heard [here](https://ottowillberg.bandcamp.com/album/barbaric-mystical-bored).

<br>

The website has been made possible with support from Sound and Music's New Voices programme, Arts Council England, PRS and RVW Trust. It has been built by [Sam Andreae](https://www.samandreae.com/).
