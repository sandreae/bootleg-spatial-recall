Select an impulse from the list above. To play the convoluted sample click the image. You can adjust the wet/dry level of the reverb by clicking on the slider. To listen to the isolated impulse, click 'impulse'. You can download the impulse to use as a reverb yourself. Note you'll need to use a reverb plugin that can convolve. Most DAWs have something like this and there are a few free plugins out there.
